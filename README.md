To run a FastAPI app, follow these steps:

1. Start the FastAPI development server by running the following command in your terminal. :

    pip install uvicorn og fastapi
    naviger til fastapi mappa i terminal. kjør kommandoen under for å starte server
    ```
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    This command starts the server and automatically reloads it whenever you make changes to your code.

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access your FastAPI app.
